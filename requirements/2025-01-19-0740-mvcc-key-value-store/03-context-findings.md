# Context Findings: MVCC Implementation

## Overview
Based on research of PostgreSQL documentation, existing MVCC implementations in Go/Rust, and academic literature, here are the key findings for implementing an in-memory MVCC key-value store.

## Core MVCC Concepts

### 1. Multi-Version Storage
- **Key Principle**: Keep multiple versions of each data item instead of overwriting
- **Data Structure**: `map[string][]Value` where each key maps to a list of versions
- **Version Ordering**: Can be newest-to-oldest (N2O) or oldest-to-newest (O2N)
- **Version Chain**: Typically implemented as a singly linked-list for efficiency

### 2. Transaction Management
- **Transaction IDs (XID)**: Sequential, unique identifiers for each transaction
- **Timestamps**: Each transaction has begin and commit timestamps
- **Metadata per Version**:
  - `created_by_txn`: Transaction ID that created this version
  - `deleted_by_txn`: Transaction ID that marked this version obsolete
  - `timestamp`: When this version was created

### 3. Visibility Rules
- Each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of data
- Visibility determined by comparing transaction timestamps
- Basic rule: A version is visible if:
  - Created before transaction started
  - Not deleted or deleted after transaction started

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Storage Architecture
```
type VersionedValue struct {
    Value         interface{}
    CreatedByTxn  uint64
    DeletedByTxn  uint64  // 0 means not deleted
    Timestamp     uint64
}

type MVCCStore struct {
    data map[string][]*VersionedValue  // Version chains
    // Additional fields for transaction management
}
```

### 2. Transaction Lifecycle
- **Begin**: Assign transaction ID and begin timestamp
- **Read**: Find appropriate version using visibility rules
- **Write**: Create new version (never modify existing)
- **Commit**: Assign commit timestamp, make changes visible
- **Abort**: Mark transaction as aborted (metadata operation)

### 3. Concurrency Control
- **Read-Write Separation**: Reads never block writes, writes never block reads
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**: Detect conflicts at commit time
- **Lock-Free Reads**: Possible with careful version chain management

## Design Considerations

### 1. Version Chain Management
- **Growth Control**: Need garbage collection for obsolete versions
- **Chain Length**: Can impact read performance
- **Storage Format**: Consider cache-friendly layouts

### 2. Transaction ID Wraparound
- PostgreSQL uses 32-bit XIDs (4 billion transaction limit)
- Need strategy for handling wraparound or use 64-bit IDs

### 3. Memory Management
- All versions stored in memory
- Need efficient memory allocation/deallocation
- Consider memory pools for version objects

### 4. Thread Safety
- Multiple threads accessing same data
- Need thread-safe data structures
- Consider read-write locks or lock-free algorithms

## API Design Patterns

### Basic Operations
```
Begin() -> Transaction
Get(txn, key) -> (value, error)
Put(txn, key, value) -> error
Delete(txn, key) -> error
Commit(txn) -> error
Rollback(txn) -> error
```

### Transaction Isolation Levels
- **Read Committed**: See committed data at statement start
- **Repeatable Read**: See snapshot at transaction start
- **Serializable**: Full serializability with conflict detection

## Performance Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Version Storage
- Use contiguous memory for version chains
- Implement custom allocators
- Consider column-store for specific workloads

### 2. Index Structures
- Skip lists for ordered access
- Hash maps for point lookups
- Consider adaptive indexes

### 3. Garbage Collection
- Background thread for version cleanup
- Epoch-based reclamation
- Reference counting for active versions

## Existing Implementations Reference

### Go Implementations
- **etcd/mvcc**: Production-ready, uses BoltDB backend
- **Key patterns**: Revision-based versioning, watch support

### Rust Implementations
- **mvcc-rs**: Optimistic MVCC for in-memory databases
- **Key patterns**: Lock-free reads, atomic operations

### PostgreSQL Patterns
- Version chains in heap pages
- Transaction status in shared memory
- Visibility checks via snapshot data

## Recommended Architecture

For this implementation:
1. Start with simple map-based storage with version lists
2. Use 64-bit transaction IDs to avoid wraparound
3. Implement snapshot isolation first (most common)
4. Add garbage collection early to manage memory
5. Design API to support future distributed extensions
6. Keep performance measurement hooks from the start

## Testing Considerations
- Concurrent transaction scenarios
- Isolation level verification
- Memory usage under load
- Version chain growth patterns
- Garbage collection effectiveness
